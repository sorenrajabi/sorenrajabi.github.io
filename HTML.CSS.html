        What are HTML and CSS used for? The basics of coding for the web
        We take a look at these two essential building blocks of web coding,
        how they are used, and the benefits of learning them.
        What Are Html Css Used For
        When it comes to building web pages, the coding language can,
        at first glance, appear incredibly complex. It may seem rather
        daunting having to take all this new information on board, but by breaking down each of the different elements involved, you’ll find that you can make sense of all these essential pieces of the puzzle.
        If you’re thinking of building a website, then you’ll almost
        certainly have come across the acronyms HTML and CSS. These two essential tools form some of the foundations of any webpage. However, although they’re often used in conjunction with each other, they both serve very different purposes when it comes to web coding.
        The key differences lie in their implementation, ease of use,
        their various features, and how they are structured, but at the
        end of the day, both HTML and CSS are the keys to unlocking how the World Wide Web works. Let’s dive into the details of both HTML and CSS, what they’re used for, and how to learn HTML and CSS.  
        
        What is HTML? 
        Let’s start by breaking down exactly what the acronym ‘HTML’ stands for.
         HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HyperText is effectively
          a text within a text, and a markup language is a language understood by
           computers, designed to essentially describe webpages and make the text you use more interactive.
        It was originally invented back in 1989 as the publishing language of the web, and to put it very simply,
         it is the first building block in creating a webpage. When you first come across the world of HTML,
          you’ll likely encounter a whole ream of terms and phrases that are somewhat baffling too.
           The three main ones are elements, tags, and attributes.   
        HTML5 is the latest ‘version’ of HTML, and knowledge in
         this area is a growing trend in the job market. By and large,
          it has the same functionality as standard HTML but is much more
           dynamic and uses much less code to build something fantastic. </p>

           What is CSS? 
CSS is the acronym for Cascade Styling Sheets. In short,
 it is a sheet style language, which is a type of language 
 you can use to describe the presentation of a markup language –
  in this case, to describe the movements of HTML. It effectively
   determines how the building blocks, as laid by HTML, are decorated and presented to the user.
CSS was first created around 1996 to make sense of HTML and make
 the webpage look and feel amazing. Just as with any language,
  you have to write CSS, and knowing how we write CSS is a skill
   that any webpage developer needs to have. Easy to maintain,
    CSS is the second part of the two-part tool kit for webpage creation.   
Web accessibility is really important to many employers and companies nowadays, and there is fierce competition in creating the most accessible and well-designed webpage. Learning some software development fundamentals involving CSS can help you learn how to create accessible web pages.
What is CSS used for? 
If HTML is the bones of the body, then CSS is the skin that covers it.
 It’s used for background colour, styling, layout, borders, shadowing –
  all the essential design bits and bobs that make a webpage look slick
   and smart. CSS enables you to distinguish between presentation
    and content by modifying the design and display of HTML elements.
Presentation and ease of use are a couple of the main things that CSS
 has bought to web design by translating the way content looks on 
 a webpage and what else goes on it to complement that content.
  While frequently used in conjunction with HTML, it is actually
